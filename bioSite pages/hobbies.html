<h1> <b>Interest</b> </h1>


<h2> <b>Popcorn Anyone?</b> </h2>

<p> 
    The perfect past time that will take you to whimsically unique realities and action-packed battles all with the click of a remote.
    Or a pre-purchased ticket. Zhordera enjoys movies and television to relax after long draining days. 
    The distractions of these stories bring joy where there is pain, healing where there may be suffering, 
    and excitement in place of the mind-numbing worries. 

</p>


<h2> <b>...5, 6, 7, 8! </b> </h2>

<p>
    Who said exercise had to be boring? 
    Although the goal isn’t necessarily to get into shape, Zhordera loves to dance whenever the opportunity allows. 
    Dance’s expressive nature is the perfect outlet for anyone looking to have fun and move. 
    The feeling of just letting go and enjoying the beat of the music, without a care in the world, is what Zhordera enjoys most. 

</p>

<h2> <b>Where to Next?</b> </h2>

<p> 
    Just like most hard-working individuals, traveling is one of the most desired activities. 
    Zhordera is no different. Having memberships that grant her access to resorts anywhere in the country, 
    she makes sure to take advantage of that. Having the opportunities, or blessings as Zhordera puts it, 
    to be able to travel and visit new places and people is something a lot wish they had. She is grateful to be able to take getaways when she can.
